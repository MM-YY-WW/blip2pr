"ARNTL2": "ARNTL2, also known as Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and other cellular processes. It is a paralog of the ARNTL (Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like) gene and is sometimes referred to as BMAL2 (Brain and muscle ARNT-like 2). ARNTL2 plays a role in the molecular clock machinery, which controls the circadian rhythms in various organisms, including humans. Circadian rhythms are the biological processes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle and regulate sleep-wake patterns, metabolism, and other physiological functions. The ARNTL2 protein forms complexes with other clock-related proteins and binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of clock-controlled genes. These genes, in turn, influence various cellular and physiological processes in a rhythmic manner. Research on ARNTL2 and circadian rhythms is important for understanding how our bodies maintain internal time and how disruptions to circadian rhythms can impact health. It also has implications for fields such as sleep medicine and the treatment of circadian rhythm-related disorders.", 
"BHLHB9": "BHLHB9, also known as Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Domain Containing Class B9, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. This gene is involved in the regulation of gene expression and plays a role in various cellular processes. Members of the bHLH family of transcription factors are known for their involvement in the control of gene expression, particularly during processes such as cell differentiation and development. These proteins often form dimers and bind to specific DNA sequences to activate or repress the transcription of target genes. The specific functions and target genes regulated by BHLHB9 may vary depending on the context, tissue, and cellular conditions. Research on BHLHB9 and other bHLH transcription factors contributes to our understanding of gene regulation and its roles in various biological processes.",
